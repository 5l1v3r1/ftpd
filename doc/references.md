There are a range of RFCs that together specify the FTP protocol. In
chronological order, the more useful ones are:

* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt RFC-959} - File Transfer Protocol
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt RFC-1123} - Requirements for Internet Hosts
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2228.txt RFC-2228} - FTP Security Extensions
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2389.txt RFC-2389} - Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2428.txt RFC-2428} - FTP Extensions for IPv6 and NATs
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2577.txt RFC-2577} - FTP Security Considerations
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2640.txt RFC-2640} - Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3659.txt RFC-3659} - Extensions to FTP
* {http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4217.txt RFC-4217} - Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol

For an english summary that's somewhat more legible than the RFCs, and
provides some commentary on what features are actually useful or
relevant 24 years after RFC959 was published:

For a history lesson, check out Appendix III of RCF959. It lists the
preceding (obsolete) RFC documents that relate to file transfers,
including the ye old RFC114 from 1971, "A File Transfer Protocol"
